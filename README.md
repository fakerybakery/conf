# HeavyHurdle Video Conferencing
A small, simple video conferencing web app built using node.js, socket.io, and WebRTC.
It runs on a peer-to-peer design, so not an ideal choice for communications between multiple noodes. However, it's a good choice for communication between 2 or 3 nodes.

## Features

* Realtime Chat
